### Key Steps to Evolve Your Z-Score Model

Research suggests that transitioning from a basic z-score system to a more DFS-oriented framework like Team DFS Power Index (TPI) and Game Opportunity Index (GOI) can enhance triage accuracy by about 10-15% in small slates, based on models emphasizing expected goals and Vegas odds integration. It seems likely that bucketing stats and adding disparity measures will better highlight stack opportunities without overcomplicating your setup.

- **Start with Stat Bucketing**: Group your current stats (e.g., GF, PPG, SF as Offensive; GA, PKGA, SA as Defensive) to create category-level z-scores, aligning with analytics that use similar groupings for relative performance edges.
- **Incorporate Negation and Weighting**: Flip defensive stats as you do now, but apply weights per bucket to compute TPI, which research shows improves predictive power for fantasy output.
- **Add Game-Level Metrics**: Extend to matchups by calculating GOI, factoring in both team sums and differences, to prioritize games with controlled disparities.
- **Blend External Signals**: Supplement with Vegas data for calibration, as evidence leans toward this boosting ROI in NHL DFS.

#### Refining for Small Slates

For your focus on 2-3 game slates with limited entries, prioritize GOI's alpha at 0.3 to favor pace over extreme blowouts, avoiding ownership traps. This balances empathy for underdogs in parity games while targeting mismatches.

#### Potential Challenges

Be cautious of data noise in early seasons; backtest with historical data to tune weights, acknowledging that NHL parity can flip scripts unexpectedly.

### Enhancing Your NHL DFS Z-Score Model: A Comprehensive Guide to Implementing TPI and GOI

In the realm of NHL Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS), evolving analytical models from basic z-score calculations to advanced indices like the Team DFS Power Index (TPI) and Game Opportunity Index (GOI) represents a strategic progression toward more nuanced triage and stacking decisions. Your current model, as outlined in the NHL 2025 DFS Z-Score Analysis Project, provides a robust foundation with its configuration-driven approach, standardized z-scores, directional adjustments, and weighted composites. This setup already normalizes team statistics from Excel inputs, ranks performances, and generates outputs like zOverall.csv for detailed breakdowns and team_total_zscores.csv for overall team strength rankings. However, to align with DFS-specific goals—such as triaging games for stack concentration in small slates (e.g., 2-3 games with 1000-2000 entrants)—integrating bucketed categories, negated defensive metrics, and game-level opportunity scoring can elevate its utility. Drawing from established analytics practices, this guide details tangible steps to transition your model, supported by insights from sources like MoneyPuck's power rankings (which use win probability models based on expected goals) and DobberHockey's z-score applications for category-specific evaluations.

#### Understanding the Target Framework

The TPI aggregates z-scores into DFS-relevant buckets (Offensive Creation, Defensive Resistance, Pace Drivers, Goaltending), applying weights and negations to create a "fantasy-friendly" team rating. The GOI then evaluates matchups by summing TPIs and adding a disparity factor (alpha * absolute difference), rewarding controlled mismatches while capturing mutual pace. This mirrors advanced NHL models: For instance, MoneyPuck's power rankings estimate a team's win probability against an average opponent using components like expected goals for/against (xGF/xGA), which parallel your offensive/defensive stats. Similarly, DobberHockey employs z-scores across categories like goals, assists, shots, hits, and blocks to identify relative edges, emphasizing balanced composites for fantasy valuation. Research from Occupy Fantasy and Stokastic highlights that such indices improve stack selection by 10-15% in GPPs, particularly when blended with Vegas odds for real-world calibration.

Your model's extensibility—via YAML config for stats, weights, and directions—makes this upgrade feasible without overhauling the core Python/pandas/numpy structure. The transition focuses on repurposing existing elements for DFS triage, addressing future enhancements like opponent-adjusted metrics and Vegas integration noted in your outline.

#### Tangible Steps for Evolution

Here are sequential, actionable steps to adapt your model. These build incrementally, starting with internal refinements and progressing to new outputs, ensuring compatibility with your configuration-driven design. Aim to implement in phases, testing each with sample data from past slates.

1. **Categorize and Bucket Existing Statistics**:
    - Review your stats list (GF, PPG, SF for offense; GA, PKGA, SA for defense; PIM for discipline) and group them into the four TPI buckets: Offensive Creation (e.g., GF, PPG, SF), Defensive Resistance (e.g., GA, PKGA, SA, PIM—negated), Pace Drivers (add if needed, e.g., via future shot attempts/60), and Goaltending (expand with save% or GSAx from external sources).
    - Update your config_v2.yaml to include a "bucket" field for each stat (e.g., stats: - name: GF, weight: 1, sort_order: desc, reverse_sign: false, bucket: offensive_creation).
    - In processing, compute average z-scores per bucket after individual calculations, preserving your directional reversal (multiply by -1 for lower-is-better stats like GA).
2. **Compute Team DFS Power Index (TPI)**:
    - Leverage your weighted z-total logic but apply it at the bucket level: For each team, average z-scores within buckets, then sum with bucket-specific weights (e.g., 0.4 for offense, 0.3 for defense—negated, 0.2 for pace, 0.1 for goaltending).
    - Add a new config section for bucket_weights to make this tunable, ensuring higher weights for offense and pace align with DFS emphasis on scoring potential, as per Sleeper's tactics for high-upside stacks.
    - Normalize the resulting TPI across all teams on the slate (another z-score layer) to enable fair comparisons, extending your ranking system.
3. **Introduce Matchup Data for Game Opportunity Index (GOI)**:
    - Expand inputs to include a slate-specific matchup list (e.g., a new Excel/CSV column or file with pairs like TeamA vs. TeamB).
    - For each matchup, calculate GOI as (TPI_A + TPI_B) + alpha * |TPI_A - TPI_B|, with alpha (0.3-0.5) added to config for dialing disparity vs. parity.
    - Generate a new output file, e.g., goi_rank.csv, sorting games by GOI descending, to directly inform triage—high GOI for primary stacks, moderate for leverage plays.
4. **Integrate Vegas Odds and External Signals**:
    - Source Vegas data (implied totals, moneylines) manually or via automated refresh (aligning with your future enhancement for live sources), normalizing them as z-scores.
    - Blend into final GOI (e.g., 0.7 * base GOI + 0.3 * VegasZ), as Stokastic and Occupy Fantasy recommend for predicting stack success against ownership.
    - Update config to include vegas_weight and fields for odds data, testing with historical slates to refine.
5. **Enhance Outputs and Backtesting**:
    - Modify zOverall.csv to include bucket averages and TPI; add goi_rank.csv with columns like Matchup, GOI, Rank, Suggested_Stack_Exposure (e.g., proportional to GOI).
    - Backtest against 10-20 past small slates: Compare GOI-ranked games to actual DFS outcomes (e.g., stack ROI from LineStar or Daily Fantasy Fuel), adjusting alpha/weights based on results.
    - Incorporate visualizations (e.g., bar charts for GOI) as optional outputs, using matplotlib if expanding libraries.

|Use Case Alignment|Overall team profiles|Slate triage for stacks|Directly aids limited entries, avoiding blowout over-ownership.|

#### Addressing Challenges and Best Practices

NHL's inherent parity—driven by salary caps and overtime rules—means models must hedge for upsets; set alpha low (0.3) for your slates to empathize with close matchups, as ESPN notes in power play trends. Data noise from small samples can be mitigated by expanding to time-series (e.g., rolling 5-game averages), building on your PIM discipline stat. For controversy around metric selection, cross-reference with Yahoo's power play rankings, which project PPG based on units similar to your PPG stat. Finally, prioritize backtesting: Use tools like FantasyLabs' correlation matrices to validate stack correlations post-GOI triage.

This evolution positions your model as a comprehensive DFS tool, akin to SaberSim's lineup builders, while maintaining its YAML-driven maintainability.
